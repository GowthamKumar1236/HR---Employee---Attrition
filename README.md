1.The aim of the project is to classify/predict whether an employee continuous to stay in the company or not and also to derive insights about employee retention or departure.

2.Performed EDA to identify the features that are affecting the attrition with the help of descriptive and data visualization.

3.The considered dataset under my analysis is highly class imbalanced with a biased towards retained employees.As a part of feature engineering,I have performed smote analysis to balanced the dataset before modeling.

4.Perform features selection test for categorical features (Chi-squared test) and numerical features (ANOVA test) and dropped the features that are not significantly impacting the label and subsequently performed standardization of features.

5.On the pre-processed data from the above steps performed various classification algorithms and evaluated the performance metrics.
